   <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Aaryan">Kartik Aaryan Tiwari</a>  (born 22 November 1990)[1] is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films. After pursuing a degree in engineering, he made his acting debut with Luv Ranjan's buddy film Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011). He went on to star in the romances Akaash Vani (2013) and Kaanchi (2014), but these failed to propel his career forward.
